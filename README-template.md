## My process

1. **Asset and Style Extraction**:

   - Started by extracting all assets from the Figma design file, including color palettes, typography, and spacing details. This step ensured that the visual elements matched the design specifications.

2. **Structuring the Code**:

   - Created a clear structure for the HTML and CSS to match the layout and design requirements. This involved setting up the foundational markup and organizing styles for easy maintenance and scalability.

3. **Leveraging Existing Knowledge**:

   - Applied previously learned techniques and best practices for CSS and HTML to implement common features and layouts. This included using Flexbox for layout management and CSS variables for consistent theming.

4. **Research and Syntax Validation**:

   - Conducted thorough research, utilizing resources and documentation (e.g., [W3Schools CSS3 Buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp), [W3Schools CSS Hover Selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php)) to validate and refine syntax. This step was crucial for ensuring compatibility and adherence to current web standards.

5. **Iterative Testing and Refinement**:

   - Continuously tested the design across different screen sizes and browsers to identify and fix any issues. This iterative process helped in achieving a responsive and user-friendly interface.

6. **Incorporating Feedback**:
   - Incorporated feedback from peers or testing results to make necessary adjustments and improvements. This step ensured that the final product met user expectations and design goals.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I learned several key aspects of styling and responsive design:

1. **Button Styling and States**:

   - I explored how to effectively style buttons using CSS, including creating hover effects. The [W3Schools CSS3 Buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp) resource was particularly useful for understanding various button styles and states. It provided practical examples of how to implement and customize button styles to enhance user experience.

2. **Hover Effects**:

   - Implementing hover effects for interactive elements was a major focus. The [W3Schools CSS Hover Selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php) resource was instrumental in learning how to apply and control hover states. This helped in making the buttons and links more interactive and visually appealing.

3. **Responsive Button Design**:

   - I learned how to ensure buttons look good across different devices by exploring [YouTube Shorts on CSS Buttons](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/P7tKk6vqgIo). This resource gave a concise overview of best practices for responsive button design, which was crucial for maintaining consistency across various screen sizes.

4. **Font Styling**:
   - Understanding font properties and how to apply them correctly was another key learning area. The [W3Schools CSS Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp) guide provided comprehensive information on font styling, including font families, sizes, and weights, which was essential for ensuring readability and visual hierarchy in the design.
